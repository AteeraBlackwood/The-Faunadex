        <p>Pyukumuku, the Sea Cucumber Pokemon, is a water type based on a sea cucumber. This Pok√©mon is capable of spitting its organs out through its mouth. The white organs can take different shapes, such as a fist. Pyukumuku tends to find a spot it likes and stay there, even returning to the same spot if moved. Once all the food in its favorite spot has been consumed, it will continue to stay there to the point of starvation.  </div>

        <p>They are marine animals with a leathery skin and an elongated body. Sea cucumbers are found on the sea floor worldwide. Sea cucumbers serve a useful role in the marine ecosystem as they help recycle nutrients, breaking down detritus and other organic matter after which bacteria can continue the degradation process. They breathe through their anus and expel their internal organs when threatened.</p>
