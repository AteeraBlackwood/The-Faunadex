        <p>Eelektross, the EleFish Pokemon is an electric type pokemon that is a cross between an eel and a sea lamprey. It is the final form of Tynamo and evolves from Eelektrik when exposed to a Thunder Stone. It lives in the ocean, but it comes ashore to capture prey. It can use its arms to crawl out of the ocean and its sucker mouth to suck in prey. After latching onto its prey using its sucker mouth, it drags the prey into the ocean. It electrifies prey before eating.

        <p>The sea lamprey is a parasitic fish native to the Northern Hemisphere. Sea lampreys are anadromous; from their lake or sea habitats, they migrate up rivers to spawn. The lamprey uses its suction cup-like mouth to attach itself to the skin of a fish and rasps away tissue with its sharp, probing tongue and keratinized teeth. A fluid produced in the lamprey's mouth, lamphredin, prevents the victim's blood from clotting. Lampreys are considered a delicacy in some parts of Europe
