          <p>The trap-jaw ants are a family of omnivorous ants found in the tropics and subtropics throughout the world. The species have a pair of large, straight mandibles capable of opening 180°. These jaws are locked in place by an internal mechanism, and can snap shut on prey or objects when sensory hairs on the inside of the mandibles are touched. The ants also use their jaws to catapult both intruders and themselves.
